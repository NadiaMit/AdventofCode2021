# Advent of Code 2021 in Java [![Java](https://skillicons.dev/icons?i=java)](https://skillicons.dev)

This is my try on the Advent of code of 2021 challanges with Java, sadly i only did 10 Days, but i got both stars on every day, so in total i had 20 points in the end.

## Structure
- `Main.java`: in this file you can find the main, that calls the days code. to call the right code, you need to add the right number here:
```java
  Days day = new DayX(reader.readInput("test.txt"));//exchange X for the number of the day
```
- `days`: the code for each day will be in the days folder as a `.java` file. I used `Days.java` to create an Interface, that I then could implement every day to be faster in writing the code for every day.
- `Inputs`: all my input data for each day is saved the inputs folder as a `.txt` file. I also have a `test.txt` file, that I use for the example input of each days puzzle.
- `Reader.java`: This class helps to read the input data.
